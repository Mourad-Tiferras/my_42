## 🧠 About

The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using **UNIX signals**.

You will create a **client-server communication system** in C:

- The **server** runs first and displays its **PID**.  
- The **client** takes the server PID and a string as arguments.  
- The client sends the string to the server **bit by bit** using `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`.  
- The server receives the message and displays it.

## Unix Processes

Minitalk uses two separate processes that communicate via signals:
- **Server Process**: waits for messages and reconstructs data.
- **Client Process**: encodes a message and sends it via signals.

---

## Unix Signals

Signals are asynchronous notifications sent to a process to notify it of an event.  
Here we use:
- `SIGUSR1` → represents binary `1`
- `SIGUSR2` → represents binary `0`

## Used Functions

| Function | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `signal()` | Sets up a signal handler for a specific signal. |
| `sigaction()` | Provides advanced control over signal handling. |
| `struct sigaction` | Structure used with `sigaction()` to specify handlers. |
| `sigemptyset()` | Initializes a signal set to exclude all signals. |
| `sigaddset()` | Adds a specific signal to a signal set. |
| `getpid()` | Returns the current process ID (PID). |
| `kill()` | Sends a signal to a process. |
| `pause()` | Suspends process until a signal is received. |
| `sleep()` / `usleep()` | Suspends execution for a given time (useful for synchronization). |

## Minitalk Explained

### Step 1
**Convert each ASCII characters to binary representation.**

### Step 2
**Send binary representation of each charachter via Unix Signals to the server PID .**

### Step 3
**Convert binary representation back to ASCII characters.**

### Step 4
**Print the client msg.**

## Project Requirements

### About
The project tests your understanding of **signals**, **processes**, and **synchronous communication**.

Keep in mind:
- Handle errors carefully — your program **must not crash**.
- Avoid **memory leaks**.
- You can use **one global variable**, but only if **justified**.

### 🧱 Mandatory Part
- Produce two executables: `server` and `client`.
- `client` must send a string (passed as argument) to `server` (identified by PID).
- Use **only `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`** for communication.
