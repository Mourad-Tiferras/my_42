The peer-to-peer model ensures that learning is collaborative, yet competitive in the sense that you push each other to improve.

# The School
> 42 is the entire network. 1337 is a part of 42.

42 is a nonprofit and private school, that offers a new methodology of learning since there are no teachers and no classrooms, students are not chained to a specific time for the reason that the school is open 24/7 days which gives them the full freedom of studying whenever they want per day.

Moreover, the school is free for whoever is selected after its selection process also known as "Piscine" which is a 30-day of coding that decides if you are qualified to attend the school and become a student.
